## Step 1: Installing NPM

To install npm on Ubuntu or Linux, invoke the command below:
```shell
sudo apt install npm
```

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the version of npm installed using the command:
```shell
npm --version

8.5.5  [Output]
```

The installation of npm also installs node.js and you can confirm the version of node installed using the command:
```shell
node --version

v17.9.0  [Output]
```

**If you have a problem with the version of Node click [here](Problems.md#problems)**

## Step 2: Installing Learnpack

Make sure you have the [learnpack-cli](https://github.com/learnpack/learnpack-cli) installed and `node.js` version 14+. This is the command to install the learnpack-cli (Please use sudo):

```shell
sudo npm i learnpack -g
```
